            <p>I am currently pursuing my B.Des (Experiential Design) Degree from Flame University, Pune.</p>
            <p>Let me explain how I got here</p>
            <p>It started with me learning about art and craft in school</p>
            <p>Slowly the interest for Drawing and sketching started to grow as I practised more</p>
