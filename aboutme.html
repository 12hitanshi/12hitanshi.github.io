            <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
            <p>I am currently pursuing my B.Des (Experiential Design) Degree from Flame University, Pune.</p>
            <p>Let me explain how I got here</p>
            <p>It started with me learning about art and craft in school</p>
            <p>Slowly the interest for Drawing and sketching started to grow as I practised more</p>
            <p>I started to take part in Sketching and Origami workshops and slowly started collecting achievements </p>
            <p>Then I finally took Commercial Arts in 11th grade, which introduced me to the word “DESIGN” </p>
            <p>Then I started to explore more about Design and started to build my interest in this field </p>
            <p>I decided to apply to best design colleges and that's how I got in Flame University</p>
